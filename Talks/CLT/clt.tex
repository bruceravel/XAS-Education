  the merge of 5 scans on a 50\,nm film of GeSb on silica, at the Ge
  edge and measured in fluorescence at NSLS X23A2.\\~

  %\frametitle{The Central Limit Theorem}
  \begin{clt}
    Given certain conditions, the mean of a sufficiently large number
    of independent random variables, each with finite mean and
    variance, will be approximately normally distributed.
  \end{clt}

  \bigskip

  In the context of an EXAFS measurement, the CLT tells us that, when a
  noisy spectrum that is dominated by statistical noise, the spectral
  noise will be distributed normally about its mean.

  \bigskip

  If we measure enough repetitions of data dominated by statistical
  noise and merge the data by computing the arithmetic mean at every
  energy point, the data will converge to the mean.

  \begin{block}{In short...}
    With patience, ugly data becomes beautiful.

\section{Practical matters}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The most basic rule of thumb}
  Before making a measurement, you have no idea what the data will
  look like.  You \textbf{cannot} know how many repetitions will be
  required before examining the first scan.
  \begin{description}
  \item[One scan?] Never$^*$ measure a single scan.  How would you
    know if something went wrong with the measurement?
  \item[Two scans?] What if the two repetitions are different?  How do
    know which one is right?
  \item[Three scans?] There you go!  Now you can know which on is
    right.  \alert{Always plan on at least three repetitions.}
  \end{description}
  \begin{bottomnote}[0.7][17.5]%
    \footnotesize%
    $^*$ Did I just say ``never''?  Yikes!  \textbf{Never} say
    ``never''!\\Why, on the very next page I am going to show examples
    where single scans were measured.

    \begin{column}{0.5\linewidth}
      These EXAFS data were taken at points in a rather large

  \frametitle{When are data dominated by statistical noise?}
  \begin{block}{}
    Any of the following issues will contribute systematic uncertainty
    to you data.  If any of these are large compared to shot noise,
    then the CLT will not be observed in a data ensemble.
  \end{block}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Your sample is well made
    \begin{itemize}
    \item homogeneous in the distribution of the absorber
    \item of an appropriate thickness
    \item no Bragg diffraction from the sample or the matrix
    \end{itemize}
  \item Your detectors are linear
    \begin{itemize}
    \item well constructed
    \item not saturated
    \item the entire signal chain is in a linear regime
    \item no induced noise on the signal chain
    \end{itemize}
  \item The source and all optics are stable in temperature and
    vibration
  \item Harmonic content is eliminated from the beam
  \item The beam strikes the sample and only the sample
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{alertblock}{}
    If all of those conditions are met, the variance in your data will
    be statistical and subject to the CLT.

  \frametitle{Data limitations}
  Here are 142 repetitions of a measurement on Cr$_2$O$_3$.  These
  were measured at the same beamline and with the same detector as the
  previous data.  The merge changes little after 16 scans.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Systematic uncertainty}

  \begin{block}{Statistical and systematic noise}
    More repetitions only solves the problem of statistical noise.
    There is systematic error -- probably sample inhomogeneity -- in
    these Cr$_2$O$_3$ data at the level of $\epsilon_k \approx 5\times
    10^{-4}$.
  \end{block}

  \bigskip

  Several things can cause systematic problems, including
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Monochromator glitches
  \item Sample inhomogeneity
  \item Non-linear detectors and/or signal chains
  \item Unstable mirrors or monochromator
  \item Gremlins!  (No food after midnight!)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{An example of a gross systematic problem}

  Here's an obvious example of a systematic problem.  These data were
  measured with a detector that has an energy-dependent non-linearity.

      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/mnchik.png}      
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \bigskip

  \begin{alertblock}{}
    No number of repetitions will ever fix that feature of the data.
    The \textbf{only} solution is to fix the detection problem.
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

  \end{center}

  Here again is the convergence of the Co on carbon data.
  It took 45 scans -- about 13 hours at my beamline -- to turn these
  data into the sort of excellent EXAFS data we like to work on.  We
  typically give users 3 days of beam time, enough for 5 or 6 such
  samples.

  \begin{alertblock}{}
    Sometimes we have to compromise on data quality in order to
    measure enough samples to make a full experiment.

    The collection of these data required only a simple calculation and
    a bit of patience.
