  \frametitle{The EXAFS Phase Shift in Hematite}

  \small
  Here is $\tilde\chi(R)$ for hematite, Fe$_2$O$_3$.
  
  \begin{center}

  \end{center}

  Hematite has a known crystal structure$^\ast$ with Fe in a
  six-coordinated oxygen octahedron.  There are 3 near neighbor oxygen
  atoms at 1.95\,\AA\ and 3 others 2.12\,\AA.

        Why is the first peak in $\tilde\chi(R)$ at about 1.4\,\AA\

  \frametitle{EXAFS Equation}
  \small
  Here's the EXAFS equation:

  \exafsequation

  The oscillatory term is a function not of $2kR$, but of
  \alert{$2kR + \Phi(k)$}.
  

  \bigskip
  
  The integral that makes $\tilde\chi(R)$ is usually done over $2k$,
  i.e. $\tilde\chi(R) = \int d(2k)\, k^{kw}\cdot\chi(k)$.  This makes
  $\tilde\chi(R)$ look somewhat like a radial distribution function
  with peaks near sensible values of $R$ (half-path-length), rather
  than $2R$ (full-path-length).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Scattering Amplitues and Phase Shifts}
  \small
  
  Remember that the complex scattering function (for which
  $\color{Blue4}F(k)$ is the amplitude and 
  ${\color{Blue4}\Phi(k)}$ is the phase) is structured and
  Z-dependent.  Here are some representative examples for elements
  from different rows of the periodic table.
  
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.5\linewidth}
      \centering $\color{Blue4}F_\Gamma(k)$\\
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{amplitudes.png}      
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\linewidth}
      \centering ${\color{Blue4}\Phi_\Gamma(k)}$ \\
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{phases.png}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  Very heavy elements have a discontinuity in
  ${\color{Blue4}\Phi(k)}$, like Pb at about 5.5\,\AA$^{-1}$.

  \bigskip

  Lighter scatterers, like O and Fe, have fairly smooth phase
  functions.
  
  \begin{bottomnote}[0.5][19]%
    These figures are from Matt Newville's
    \href{http://xafs.org/Tutorials?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Newville_xas_fundamentals.pdf}{\color{LightBlue4}Fundamentals of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure}
  \end{bottomnote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Examining the Phase Function}
  \small
  
  The phase functions for the lighter elements are valued near 0 at
  $k=0$\,\AA$^{-1}$ and decrease to almost 20 at $k=20$\,\AA$^{-1}$.
  To some level of approximation, these phase functions can be
  described by a line of slope -1, i.e. $\Phi(k) \approx -1\cdot k$

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{slope.pdf}
  \end{center}

  Using that crude approximation, the oscillatory term of the EXAFS
  equation is $\sin(2kR - k) = \sin\big(2k\cdot(R-\frac{1}{2})\big)$.
  When the integral is done over $d(2k)$, the first peak in the
  resulting $\tilde\chi(R)$ shows up around (R-$\frac{1}{2})$\,\AA.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{This is why the first peak is shifted inward}
  Obviously, the approximation of $\Phi(k)$ as a straight line is
  inaccurate.  The peak shift is not exactly $\frac{1}{2}$\,\AA.  And
  for heavier scatterers, the approximation is even worse.

  \bigskip

  But this explains in a hand-waving sense why the peaks are shifted
  to lower $R$ in $\tilde\chi(R)$.

  \bigskip

  This is yet another reason why $\tilde\chi(R)$ is \textbf{NOT} a
  radial distribution function.
