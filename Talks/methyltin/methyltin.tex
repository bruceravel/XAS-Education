\section{Background}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The science}
  \footnotesize%
  Polyvinyl chloride -- PVC -- is a type of rigid plastic used for
  water and sewage transport in the United States and elsewhere.  In
  the US, home building codes require copper pipe for bringing water
  into homes and PVC for carrying water and sewage out of home.

  \medskip

  The manufacture of PVC uses organic tin species, mostly dimethyl
  tin, as a stabilizing agent.  Over time, organic tin species can
  leach out of PVC and into municipal water supplies.  My collaborator,
  Chris Impellitteri, at the US Environmental Protection Agency studied
  this leaching process.  The organic tin species used as stabilizers
  evolve during the manufacturing process, so we used XAS to identify
  and characterize the tin species present in commercial PVC pipes.

  \medskip

  To start, we have built a library of organic (methyl tin, butyl tin,
  phenyl tin, tricyclohexyl tin, etc) and inorganic (metallic tin, tin
  oxide, tin chloride) standard compounds.  To have confidence that we
  could interpret spectra measured on PVC samples, we first carefully
  analyze the standards.  In this document, I show the analysis of two
  methyl tin species.

  \medskip

  As well as being a real-world example of using Artemis, this will
  serve to introduce several important concepts, including running
  {\feff} from a molecule rather than a crystal, multiple data set
  fitting, and the concept of constraining parameters across data
  sets.

  \medskip

  This document is intended as a supplement to the
  demonstration/lecture on the same topic that I give as a part of an
  XAS training course.

\section{Simple fitting model}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Create a simple fitting model}
  \footnotesize%
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Import the dimethytin dichloride (DMT) data from the {\athena}
    project file
  \item Import the \file{feff.inp} file for DMT
  \item Run {\feff} then drag and drop the first two paths
    (Sn$\leftrightarrows$C and Sn$\leftrightarrows$Cl) onto the
    DMT data.
  \item Create guess parameters for an overall amplitude and an
    overall E$_0$ shift.
  \item We cannot expect to share $\sigma^2$ or $\Delta R$ 
    between the C and Cl scatterers, so create 4 more parameters for
    those.  That comes to \alert{6} {\guessp} parameters.
  \item With the k-range set to [2:10.5] and the R-range set to
    [1:2.4], we have at most about \alert{7.5} independent points.
  \end{enumerate}

      Guess 1 for the amplitude, 0 for both $\Delta R$ parameters and
      0.003 for both $\sigma^2$ parameters.

  \frametitle{Results of the first fit}
  \small
  The fit doesn't seem bad.  The {\color{Red3}red line} over-plots the
  {\color{Blue3}blue line} rather well.  Unfortunately, the amplitude
  and both $\sigma^2$ parameters are suspiciously large, and one
  correlation is quite alarming.

  These data are severely stressed by fitting 6 parameters with barely
  more information.  That is the likely cause of the odd results.

  \frametitle{An unstable fit}

  There is an even worse aspect of the fit -- it turns out to be
  unstable.  The result we just found is some kind of local minimum,
  but perhaps not the best fit.  Guessing 0.02 for \texttt{dr\_cl}
  results in the following:

  This is an improvement in that the amplitude and the $\sigma^2$
  values are much more in line with what we expect, but correlations
  remain quite high.

  \medskip

  The next trick to try is a \alert{multiple data set} fit.
\end{frame}

\section{Multiple data set fit}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Setting up a multiple data set fit}
  Import the monomethyltin trichloride (MMT) from the {\athena}
  project file.  This will open a second Data window and place a
  second item in the list of data sets.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/mds.png}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Cloning paths from DMT to MMT}
  \small
  Drag and drop both paths from the DMT window to the MMT window.
  Path drag and drop works by clicking on a path in the path list of
  the source \textit{while holding down the control key}.

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{images/MMT.png}
  \end{center}
  
  Change the N of the Sn$\leftrightarrows$C path to 1, since
  monomethyltin only has one methyl ligand.  Similarly, change the N
  of the Sn$\leftrightarrows$Cl path to 3, since there are three Cl ligands.
\end{frame}

\newtheorem{assumption}[theorem]{Assumption}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Discussion}
  \begin{assumption}
    The Sn--C and Sn--Cl bonds are identical in DMT and MMT, thus we
    can use the same $\sigma^2$ and $\Delta R$ parameters for each
    data set.
  \end{assumption}

  Given this assumption, the fitting situation is much improved.  We
  have \alert{doubled} the information content while introducing
  \alert{0} additional parameters!  Both data sets contribute to the
  determination of our {\guessp} parameters.

  \begin{columns}
    \begin{column}{0.5\linewidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/MDS_fit.png}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\linewidth}
      The best fit values are much the same as for the better single
      data set fit.  The fit, however, is more stable and independent
      of the starting values.  The correlations are mostly smaller.
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What's next?}
  \small
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Could the Fourier transform range be longer?  Look at the k123
    plot for each data set.  (I changed the k-range before making the
    plot on the previous page.)
  \item Could the fitting range be longer?  Well, there is not much
    signal beyond the first shell above the noise level.  Simply
    expanding the R-range to make $N_{idp}$ larger without actually
    including paths in that contribute spectral weight in the extended
    range is cheating.
  \item Is the assumption about the bonds in the two samples valid?
    How would you go about testing that assumption?
  \item Trimethyltin monochloride would have been a useful
    measurement....
  \item The $\Delta R$s for both Sn$\leftrightarrows$C and the
    Sn$\leftrightarrows$Cl are somewhat large.  The fit might be
    improved by adjusting the original \file{feff.inp}, re-running
    {\feff}, and re-doing the fit.
  \item The structure used in the {\feff} calculation is unbounded
    from the outside, which might effect the construction of muffin
    tins.  Packing water moelcues around the DMT molecule might help.
  \item Is the DMT {\feff} calculation transferable to MMT?  Running
    {\feff} on MMT might help.
  \end{enumerate}
