  \frametitle{The amplitude parameter}
  \small%
  The amplitude parameter evaluates to something around 0.7 in the
  {\fes} fit.  This is at the low end of what is expected$^1$ for an
  $S_0^2$ parameter.  Lots of things are correlated with amplitude:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Coordination number, although this is a pure standard, so it
    is unlikely that coordination numbers are different from what we
    expect
  \item Sample preparation: I do not know the provenance of these
    data.  (They were taken from
    \href{http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~newville/ModelLib/search.html}
    {\color{Blue4}an on-line XAS data library}.$^2$) If the sample was
    not homogeneous, that would attenuate the amplitude$^3$ by the
    ``pinhole efffect''.
  \item Again, without knowing the provenance, I cannot comment on the
    linearity of the detectors or any other aspect of the measurement.
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{conclusion}
    A result of $\sim0.7$ for amplitude seems acceptable.
  \end{conclusion}

      \footnotesize%
      Here we see the contribution in $k$ of the scattering from the 6
      S atoms in the 2$^{\mathrm{nd}}$ shell and the 2 S atoms in the
      3$^{\mathrm{rd}}$ shell.

      \medskip

      These shells are separated in distance by 0.15\,\AA, which is
      just enough to have them contribute almost completely out of
      phase.

      \medskip

      This is the reason that the $\sigma^2$ parameter for the
      3$^{\mathrm{rd}}$ shell is so unreliable (indeed, negative when
      floated independently).  The fit was
      relatively insensitive to that parameter because it could reduce
      the 2$^{\mathrm{nd}}$ shell $\sigma^2$ to compensate for the
      unphysically small $\sigma^2$ from the 3$^{\mathrm{rd}}$ shell.
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \begin{conclusion}
    While it is certainly unphysical to constrain these two $\sigma^2$
    parameters, the fit is more defensible with this constraint.

  \frametitle{The $\sigma^2$ constraints on the MS paths}
  The $\sigma^2$ parameters for the three paths involving collinear MS
  among the absorber and the 1$^{\mathrm{st}}$ shell S atoms are all
  correct.$^1$

  \bigskip

  The $\sigma^2$ parameters for the non-collinear MS paths are rather
  hokey approximations.  The problem is that we don't have a good
  model to account for the effects on $\sigma^2$ of all the legs of
  the path nor of the disorder in scattering angle.  I worry about
  introducing a new fitting parameter to account for a rather small
  effect in the data.  We need to approximate.

  \begin{assertion}
    The $\sigma^2$ constraints for the triangle MS paths are
    non-physical approximations, but are a better solution than
    floating one or more new parameters in the fit.
  \end{assertion}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The fourth shell S}
  Because the $\sigma^2$ for the 4$^{\mathrm{th}}$ shell S atom is so
  large, we see no improvement to the fit by introducing this
  scatterer.  

  \begin{center}
    Why is its $\sigma^2$ so large?
  \end{center}

  That's hard to say without help from theory, but clearly the
  relative positions of the absorber and this rather distant atom have
  a large thermal disorder.

  \begin{conclusion}
    It is safe to exclude this scatterer from the fit.  Indeed, the
    fit is improved by not having its frail $\sigma^2$ parameter in
    the fit.
  \end{conclusion}

  It would be interesting to measure this material at 10\,K to see if
  the signal from this distant atom could be observed.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The remaining MS paths}
  Nine of the first 15 paths from the {\feff} calculation were
  included in the fit.  The remaining 6 paths are MS paths with small
  amplitudes.  We got a sensible fit with a model which excluded these
  paths.  It would be a good exercise to figure out a sensible
  parameterization of their $\sigma^2$s, include them in the fit, and
  determine if the fit is improved by having them.

  \begin{conclusion}
    It was safe to exclude these paths, but this should be verified by
    examining the fits with and without those paths.
  \end{conclusion}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The parameterization of $\Delta R$}
  \footnotesize%
  {\fes} is a cubic crystal.  In this case, there are only two
  parameters that determine the locations of \textbf{all} the atoms in
  the cluster -- the lattice constant $a$ and the position of the S
  atom in the unit cell.  For now, we neglect the effect of  the
  position of the S atom.

  \medskip

  Why is the parameterization that sets $\Delta R=\alpha\cdot R_{eff}$
  acceptible for all paths?

  \begin{itemize}
    \footnotesize%
  \item The distance between \textit{any two atoms in a cubic crystal} is some
    geometrical factor multiplied by the lattice constant.  That
    factor depends on the positions of the atoms in the unit cell, but
    is a pure number.
  \item Thus, from the {\feff} calculation, $d_{eff}(i,j) =
    C_{ij}\cdot a_0$ for any two atoms i and j
  \item We consider an isotropic expansion (or contraction) of the
    unit, which is reasonable for a cubic lattice that does not
    undergo a phase transition.  So $a=(1+\alpha)*a_0$.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.15\linewidth}
      ~
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.35\linewidth}
      \begin{align}
        d_{ij} =& d_{eff}(i,j) + \Delta d(i,j)\notag\\
        =& C_{ij} \cdot a \notag\\
        =& C_{ij} \cdot (1+\alpha)\cdot a_0 \notag\\
        =& C_{ij}\cdot a_0 + C_{ij}\cdot \alpha\cdot a_0\notag
      \end{align}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.35\linewidth}
      \begin{align}
        \therefore \> \Delta d(i,j) =& C_{ij}\cdot \alpha\cdot a_0\notag\\
        =& \alpha\cdot d_{eff}(i,j)\notag
      \end{align}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.15\linewidth}
      ~
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
  \begin{conclusion}
    $\alpha\cdot d_{eff}$ works for all legs of any SS or MS path in a
    cubic crystal (if there are no internal degrees of freedom). The
    $R$ of a path is the sum of $d$ for each leg, thus $\Delta R$ for
    a path is the sum of $\Delta d$ for each leg.\\[-5.5ex]
    \begin{flushright}
      \alert{This trick is \textbf{only} valid for a cubic crystal.}
    \end{flushright}
  \end{conclusion}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Improving on the parameterization of $\Delta R$}
  In the crystal data for {\fes}, the S atom is at position (0.384,
  0.384, 0.384), or ($\frac{3}{8}+\delta$, $\frac{3}{8}+\delta$,
  $\frac{3}{8}+\delta$), where $\delta=0.009$.

  \medskip

  The effect of changing $\delta$ can be incorporated into the math
  expressions for $\Delta R$ for any path that includes a S atom.
  Doing so is beyond the scope of this document.

  \begin{exercise}
    Examine the \file{feff.inp} file for {\fes}.  Think about how to
    incorporate the effect of $\delta$ into a fit.
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Correlations}
  We have a pretty robust set of parameters in our fit.  Only two of
  the correlations are above 60\%.  

  \begin{description}[$\Delta E_0$ and $\alpha$]
  \item[$\Delta E_0$ and $\alpha$] This correlation is about 86\%.
    That is reasonable.  Those are the only two parameters effecting
    the phase of the fit.  This is a common level of correlation for
    such parameters.
  \item[1$^{\mathrm{st}}$ shell $\sigma^2$ and amplitude] This
    correlation is about 81\%.  Again, this is pretty common for two
    things that have such an effect on overall amplitude of the fit.
  \end{description}

  \begin{conclusion}
    The correlations we see are within acceptable limits.

  \frametitle{The happiness ``parameter''}
  \small
  \begin{remember}
    Happiness is a semantic parameter and should NEVER be reported in
    a publication -- \alert{NEVER!}
  \end{remember}
  We have decades of knowledge of how the parameters of an EXAFS fit
  should behave.  ``Happiness'' attempts to encode that general
  knowledge into a single, \emph{non-statistical}, entirely semantic parameter.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The $\mathcal{R}$-factor should be small.  An
    $\mathcal{R}$-factor below 0.02 gives no penalty. Above that, the
    penalty scales linearly to some maximum.
  \item A penalty is assessed if more than 2/3 of the number of
    independent points are used.
  \item A penalty for each Path with a negative $S_0^2$ or $\sigma^2$
    value.
  \item A penalty for each $E_0$, $\Delta R$, or $\sigma^2$ path
    parameter that is ``too big''.
  \item A penalty is assessed for each correlation above 0.95.
  \item A penalty is assessed for each non-zero restraint.
  \end{itemize}
  The evaluation of the happiness is tunable via configuration parameters.
