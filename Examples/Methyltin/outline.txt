
				  METHYL TIN
				  ==========

1.  import dimethyl tin dichloride data from Athena project file

2.  show image of DMT-diCl in molecule viewer

3.  show PDB file, explain how that was converted into a feff.inp file

4.  import feff.inp file into Artemis

5.  run Feff, import no paths

6.  import C and Cl SS paths from Feff interpretation page

7.  plot these paths along with the data

8.  parameterize these two paths with a simple model.  each one gets a deltaR
    and sigma^2 parameter.

9.  fit with kw=2, k-range [2:10.5], R-range [1:2.4]
    this is 6 parameters and 7 independent points.  hmmm....

10. re-run the fit with kw=1,2,3, discuss correlations between deltaR and e0,
    sigma^2 and amplitude

11. multiple data set fit as a solution to the information problem, explain
    what monomethyl tin trichloride is, import MMT data

12. clone Feff calculation

13. fix N's for MMT paths

14. fix params so MMT has all the same data parameters as DMT

15. fit and examine, do a stacked plot



Lessons:
-------

1.  The big lesson is how and why for multiple data set fits
2.  multiple k-weight fits
3.  constraints between data sets
4.  these three things together consitute good "model building" and better use
    the available information
